# INS: Instructions

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
! Please use Adafruit Library v1.01 NOT v1.03 as I had trouble                 !
! with the compiler not being able to find the header file.                    !
! This may not happen but the header file's path is different so               !
! it needs to be changed if v1.03 is to be used.                               !
!                                                                              !
! This was only tested with v1.01 only                                         !
!                                                                              !
! Serial baud rate must be set to 115200                                       !
