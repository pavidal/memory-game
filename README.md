# Big Brain Game
This is a memory game I've made for the Arduino Uno as my Embedded Systems coursework.
It features a "Free Play" infinite mode for practise and a "Story Mode" which progressively gets more difficult.

## Requirements
- Arduino Uno
- Adafruit 16x2 RGB LCD Shield display

## Dependencies
| Library                         | Version |
|---------------------------------|---------|

| Adafruit RGB LCD Shield Library | 1.01    |
